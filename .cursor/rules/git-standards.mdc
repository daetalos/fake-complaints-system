# Git Standards

This document outlines the standards and best practices for using Git in this project. Adhering to these standards ensures a clean, understandable, and maintainable version history.

## Core Workflow

1.  **Branching:** All new work, including features and bugfixes, MUST be done on a feature branch created from the latest version of the `main` branch.
    -   Before creating a new branch, always run `git checkout main` followed by `git pull origin main` to ensure you are starting from the most up-to-date point.
2.  **Merging:** Feature branches MUST be merged into `main` exclusively through Pull Requests (PRs) on the remote Git provider (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
    -   **NEVER** merge a local feature branch directly into your local `main` branch (`git merge my-feature`).
    -   **NEVER** push directly to the `main` branch. This should be enforced with branch protection rules on the remote.
3.  **Staying Updated:** To incorporate new changes from `main` into your active feature branch, use `git rebase main`. This maintains a clean, linear history. Avoid using `git merge main` for this purpose.

## Commit Messages

## Core Requirements
**ALWAYS follow conventional commit standards and maintain a clean Git history.** Establish consistent Git workflows from project inception.

## Conventional Commits Standard

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Required Commit Types
- **feat**: A new feature for the user
- **fix**: A bug fix for the user
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that don't affect meaning (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies

### Commit Message Examples
```bash
# ✅ Good Examples
feat(auth): add JWT token validation middleware
fix(api): resolve database connection timeout issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(backend): format code with black formatter
refactor(database): extract connection logic to separate module
perf(api): optimize user query with database indexing
test(auth): add unit tests for login functionality
chore(deps): update fastapi to version 0.104.0
ci(github): add automated testing workflow
build(docker): update python base image to 3.11

# ✅ Breaking Changes
feat(api)!: change user authentication to OAuth2
BREAKING CHANGE: The /auth/login endpoint now requires OAuth2 instead of basic auth

# ❌ Bad Examples
"Fixed stuff"                    # Too vague
"Updated files"                  # No context
"WIP"                           # Not descriptive
"asdf"                          # Meaningless
"Fixed the thing that was in a broken state" # Too casual
```

## Branch Naming Conventions

### Branch Types and Patterns
```bash
# Feature branches
feature/user-authentication
feature/payment-integration
feature/dashboard-ui

# Bug fix branches
fix/login-redirect-issue
fix/memory-leak-in-parser
hotfix/critical-security-patch

# Release branches
release/v1.2.0
release/v2.0.0-beta

# Development branches
develop
main (or master)

# Personal/experimental branches
chore/update-dependencies
docs/api-documentation
refactor/database-layer
```

### Branch Naming Rules
- Use lowercase with hyphens (kebab-case)
- Include ticket number when applicable: `feature/AUTH-123-user-login`
- Keep names concise but descriptive
- Use prefixes: `feature/`, `fix/`, `hotfix/`, `release/`, `chore/`

```

## Git Workflow Standards

### Repository Initialization: The First Push
**To avoid bootstrap paradoxes, the `main` branch MUST be created on the remote repository with a single, minimal commit *before* any feature development begins.** This allows the very first feature to be managed through a proper pull request.

**Procedure for a New Repository:**

1.  **Initialize the local repository.**
    ```powershell
    git init
    git config --local init.defaultBranch main
    ```

2.  **Create essential root files.**
    At a minimum, create a `README.md` and a comprehensive `.gitignore`.
    ```powershell
    New-Item README.md
    New-Item .gitignore
    # (Then, populate .gitignore from the template below)
    ```

3.  **Make the initial commit.**
    ```powershell
    git add README.md .gitignore
    git commit -m "chore(project): initial commit"
    ```

4.  **Add the remote and push `main`.**
    This establishes the `main` branch on the remote server.
    ```powershell
    git remote add origin <your-remote-repository-url>
    git push -u origin main
    ```

5.  **Immediately create your first feature branch.**
    All subsequent work MUST be done on a feature branch.
    ```powershell
    git checkout -b feature/PROJECT-1-initial-project-setup
    ```

### Feature Development Workflow
```powershell
# Start new feature
git checkout main; git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat(auth): add JWT token validation"

# For multi-line commits, it is safer to run 'git commit' without flags
# to open a text editor, avoiding potential shell parsing issues.
# Example:
# git commit 
# (This will open VS Code, Nano, Vim, etc. to write the full message)

# Push feature branch
git push -u origin feature/user-authentication

# Create pull request via GitHub CLI or web interface
# Note: Ensure 'gh' is installed and authenticated
gh pr create --title "feat(auth): add user authentication" --body "Implements JWT-based authentication system"

# After review and approval
git checkout main; git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/user-authentication
```

### Hotfix Workflow
```powershell
# Create hotfix from main
git checkout main; git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-security-patch

# Fix and commit
git add .
git commit -m "fix(security): patch SQL injection vulnerability"

# Push and create urgent PR
git push -u origin hotfix/critical-security-patch
gh pr create --title "URGENT: Security patch" --body "Fixes critical SQL injection vulnerability"

# Deploy immediately after review
```

### Release Workflow
```powershell
# Create release branch
git checkout main; git pull origin main
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0

# Update version numbers and changelog
# Commit version changes
git commit -m "chore(release): bump version to 1.2.0"

# Create release PR
git push -u origin release/v1.2.0
gh pr create --title "Release v1.2.0" --body "Release version 1.2.0 with new features and bug fixes"

# After merge, tag the release
git checkout main; git pull origin main
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0"
git push origin v1.2.0
```

# Check who changed what
git blame filename.py
git show commit-hash
```


**Remember: Consistent Git practices are essential for team collaboration. Always use conventional commits, maintain clean history, and follow established branching strategies.**

### Pull Request Content Generation

**ALWAYS generate a complete pull request description after pushing a feature or fix branch.** This is a critical step to ensure clear communication and efficient code reviews. The generated content should be based on the project's `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

**Procedure:**
1.  After pushing the branch, identify that a pull request needs to be created.
2.  Read the `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` to understand the required structure.
3.  Generate a complete title and body for the pull request, filling out all relevant sections of the template.
4.  Present this content to the user to be copied into the pull request on the Git hosting platform.

This ensures that every PR is well-documented from the moment of its creation.

## Merging and Rebasing
```

### Continuing Development After a Merge

**After a feature pull request is merged, the local `main` branch must be updated, and a new feature branch must be created from it for the next task.** This ensures a clean history and prevents old feature branches from being stacked on top of each other.

**Procedure:**
1.  **Switch to the local `main` branch:**
    ```powershell
    git checkout main
    ```
2.  **Pull the latest changes from the remote `main` branch:**
    This syncs your local repository with the newly merged code.
    ```powershell
    git pull origin main
    ```
3.  **Create a new feature branch for the next task:**
    Name the branch according to the conventional commit standard.
    ```powershell
    git checkout -b feat/PROJECT-3-linting-and-formatting
    ```
4.  **Delete the old, merged feature branch:**
    This keeps your local repository clean.
    ```powershell
    git branch -d name-of-old-feature-branch
    ```
