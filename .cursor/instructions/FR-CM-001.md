### Execution Plan: FR-CM-001 Complaint Entry Form

**1. Database: Create Complaint Table** (`@database-architecture`, `@type-safety`, `@lint-code-format`)
- [x] Define and create a database migration for a `complaints` table.
- [x] **Schema:**
    - [x] `complaint_id` (Primary Key, e.g., UUID)
    - [x] `description` (Text, Not Null)
    - [x] `created_at` (Timestamp, Not Null)
    - [x] `updated_at` (Timestamp, Not Null)

**2. Backend: Implement Complaint Creation API** (`@type-safety`, `@database-architecture`, `@lint-code-format`)
- [x] Create a `POST /complaints` endpoint.
- [x] The endpoint accepts a JSON body with a `description` field.
- [x] **Logic:**
    - [x] Validate that the `description` is not empty. Return a 400 error if it is.
    - [x] On successful validation, save the new complaint to the database.
    - [x] Return the complete complaint object (including `complaint_id` and timestamps) with a 201 status code.

**3. Frontend: Develop Complaint Entry Form** (`@frontend-react-best-practices`, `@type-safety`, `@logging-standards-frontend`, `@lint-code-format`)
- [x] Create a new page at `/complaints/new`.
- [x] **UI Components:**
    - [x] A multi-line text field for `Description`.
    - [x] A "Submit" button.
- [x] **Functionality:**
    - [x] Implement required-field validation on the `Description` field, showing an error message if it's empty on submission attempt.
    - [x] On submit, send a POST request with the form data to the `/complaints` backend endpoint.
    - [x] Display a success notification upon successful creation.
    - [x] Display an error notification if the API returns an error.

**4. Testing: Write End-to-End Test** (`@testing-tools`, `@lint-code-format`)
- [x] Create an E2E test for the complaint submission process.
- [x] **Test Flow:**
    - [x] Navigate to the `/complaints/new` page.
    - [x] Verify that submitting the form with an empty description shows a validation error.
    - [x] Fill in the description and submit the form.
    - [x] Confirm that a success message is displayed.
    - [x] (Optional) Verify the data was persisted by making a separate API call.

### Learnings & Process Improvements

To prevent similar issues in future features, the following "Pre-Flight Check" process should be adopted before starting development:

**1. Create an API "Smoke Test" to Verify Full Connectivity**
- **Action:** Before implementing feature endpoints, create a simple `GET /api/health` endpoint in the backend. The frontend should call this on startup.
- **Prevents:** Catches foundational networking issues early, such as NGINX proxy misconfigurations, Docker networking problems, and incorrect API path prefixes.

**2. Generate Frontend Types from the Backend OpenAPI Spec**
- **Action:** Use a tool like `openapi-typescript` to automatically generate TypeScript types for the frontend directly from the backend's `/openapi.json` specification.
- **Prevents:** Eliminates data contract bugs and manual inconsistencies between frontend and backend models (e.g., `UUID` vs. `int`).

**3. Implement and Rely on Docker Healthchecks**
- **Action:** Add `healthcheck` configurations to services in `docker-compose.yml`, particularly for managing dependencies like the database.
- **Prevents:** Avoids service race conditions and makes container crash loops easier to diagnose by providing clear `healthy` or `unhealthy` states.
