# Error Handling & Logging Overview

## Important Note
**This rule has been split into two focused rules for better maintainability:**

1. **Backend Error Handling & Logging Rule (Loguru)** - For Python/FastAPI backend logging and error handling
2. **Frontend Error Handling & Logging Rule (Sentry)** - For React/TypeScript frontend error tracking

## Quick Reference

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)
- Use **Loguru** for structured logging
- Implement custom exception classes
- Add request/response middleware logging
- Include performance and security event tracking

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)  
- Use **Sentry** for error tracking and performance monitoring
- Implement React Error Boundaries
- Add API call logging with performance metrics
- Track user actions and page views

## Integration
Both systems work together to provide full-stack observability:
- Backend logs structured JSON events
- Frontend sends errors and performance data to Sentry  
- Both integrate with monitoring dashboards
- Consistent error correlation across the stack


**Refer to the individual focused rules for detailed implementation patterns and code examples.**
